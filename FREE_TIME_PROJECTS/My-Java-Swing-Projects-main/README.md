The Java Swing Projects I have implemented in my free time:

1-) A calculator done by using Java Swing (Intellij IDE is used as the code editor).

2-) A Java Swing based weight converter (Apache NetBeans is used as the code editor).

3-) A Java Swing based length converter (Apache NetBeans is used as the code editor).
